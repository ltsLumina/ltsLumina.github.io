### Description {id="description_7"}

Palindra is an atmospheric puzzle game where you explore a mysterious house to find a way out.  
To escape, players must piece together clues hidden in objects and the environment. The game's main feature is a
time-travel mechanic, which creates more complex puzzles that challenge players to think across different timelines.
This concept also introduced unique hurdles for level design and asset creation.
