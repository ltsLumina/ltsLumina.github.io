## About Me

##### Hello! 
I'm Alexander, but I go by Lumina online.  
I am a university student with an overwhelming passion for game development, and I am currently studying game development at LBS Kreativa Gymnasiet Göteborg.  
I have 4 years of experience with Unity and C#, and limited experience with Unreal Engine and C++.

My goal as a developer is to be the very best I can be and to create games that people enjoy.  
I truly believe that games are a structural and defining part of society that can be used to tell stories and convey emotions in a way that no other medium can.
