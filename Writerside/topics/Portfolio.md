## About Me

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itslumina/)

##### Hello! 
I'm Alexander, but I go by Lum/Lumina online.
I am a student at Futuregames in Malmö, Sweden, studying game programming.
My experience with Unity and C# spans 4 years, and I have limited experience with Unreal Engine and C++.

I wish to one day be able to say that I create video games that people all over the world enjoy and love.
Video games have become a staple in society, and is a cultural phenomenon that has grown to be a part of many people's lives.
I want to be a part of that, to create experiences that people can enjoy and remember for years to come.

I truly believe that games are a structural and defining part of society that can be used to tell stories and convey emotions in a way that no other medium can.
