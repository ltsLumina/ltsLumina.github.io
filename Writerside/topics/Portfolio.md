## About Me

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itslumina/)

##### Hello! 

My name is Alexander "Lum" Seguin (*pen name*), and I'm driven to create games that people love. 
I believe video games are one of the most powerful storytelling mediums of our time, and I'm excited to bring those stories to life. 
As a Game Design student at Futuregames, I'm building on 4 years of Unity/C# experience and over a year with Unreal/C++ to help turn that vision into a reality.
