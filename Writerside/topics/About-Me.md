Hello, I'm Alexander "Lum" Andrejeff, a Game Designer based in Stockholm, Sweden.   
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I also go by Alexander Seguin as a pen name, in respect to my mother and grandmother.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I am a Character Designer, with a background in game programming, in part thanks to my education at LBS (High School), and Futuregames Malmö.  
Although I have an education in programming, I am mostly self-taught.

## Who am I?

I'm a Swedish-born Finnish-Canadian, with an unmatched dedication and drive to learn, improve, and create.  

What has historically set me apart from my classmates is the amount of time and effort that I put into this medium — Game Development. 
(That em dash was not written by AI, thank you very much.)  
I spend countless hours sharpening my skills, because I find so much joy in it, and the community it has embellished.  

In my spare time I like to work on personal projects, spend time with friends and family, listen to music (Linkin Park), take walks along the river, and teach what I have learned to my friends and classmates.  

As a kind gesture, I have made three tutorials for my classmates about [introduction to C#](https://youtu.be/phrRxSfoEDY), [Unity's new Input System](https://youtu.be/2kVET-s6wxM), and a [comprehensive guide on Unreal Engine 5](https://youtu.be/y5bmsADBKYw). The tutorials are 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 3 hours long respectively.  

Through my own experience with learning game development, I'm putting my own time into helping those around me to learn that which I had to learn mostly on my own through years of hands-on trial and error.  
In the workplace, I try to push that even further, providing people with ample opportunities to reach out about assistance, or if they are open to learning anything new.  

I am very often walking around the campus, socializing with the other disciplines. Strong communication between disciplines is integral, and as a designer, that responsibility falls on me. Therefore, I make sure to refine that skill as often as possible.

**In one sentence**, I would describe myself as a passionate, technical, and understanding person, with a lot of love for the people and industry.
