Hello, I'm Alexander "<b>Lum</b>" Andrejeff, a Game Designer based in Stockholm, Sweden.   
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I also go by Alexander <b>Seguin</b> as a pen name, in respect to my mother and grandmother.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I am a Gameplay Designer, with a background in game programming, in part thanks to my education at LBS (High School), and Futuregames Malmö.  
Although I have an education in programming, I am mostly self-taught.
</p>

<p>
<b>Fun Fact:</b> This website was made with the code-documentation tool "Writerside," rather than through traditional website-making means.  
Using it was close enough to writing code that I figured I would try to make something out of it. With enough dedication, and reading a lot of documentation, I figured something out -- and I think it looks neat!

## Who am I?

I'm a Swedish-_born_ **Finnish-Canadian**, with an unmatched dedication and drive to **learn**, **improve**, **teach**, and **create**. I have a growth mindset, which pushes me to iterate on existing skills, and to always be willing to learn new things.  

In my spare time I like to work on personal projects, spend time with friends and family, listen to music (Linkin Park), and teach whatever I can to those around me.

Through my own experience with learning game development, I'm putting my own time into helping those around me to learn that which I had to learn mostly on my own through years of trial and error. In the workplace, I try to push that even further, providing people with ample opportunities to reach out about anything they might need help with.

I am very often walking around the campus, socializing with the other disciplines. Strong communication between disciplines is integral, and as a designer, that responsibility falls on me. Therefore, I make sure to refine that skill as often as possible.

**In one sentence**, I would describe myself as a passionate, technical, and understanding person, with a lot of love for people and the industry.

## Why do I make games, and for whom do I make them?

> [Mats "Ibelin" Steen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remarkable_Life_of_Ibelin)

Games are a medium unlike any other, providing people of all kinds with a place to feel accepted and build friendships and
communities, regardless of disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, religion, or age.

A man who was unable to live a regular life due to a condition he was born with, was able to live an entirely secret and
fulfilling life through World of Warcraft, experiencing friendship, love, and all other kinds of experiences and
feelings he otherwise could not.

This is why I make games -- to provide those people who need them most with an outlet to connect.

The primary reason why Riot Games is so appealing to me is because of the unmatched outreach and sheer number of people
that their games reach and affect every day.  
To be part of that would mean more to me than words can express.
