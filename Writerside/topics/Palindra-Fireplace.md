Here is a breakdown of my design contributions to the game "Palindra," a first-person narrative puzzle game developed in Unity.

<h2 style="color: #ff7b7c;">FIREPLACE PUZZLE</h2>

The piano puzzle was designed with the intent of being an interactive puzzle, providing audio and visual feedback to the player. The player must find and play the correct sequence of notes to receive a key required for progression.

Inside the piano room, the piano takes center stage, marking it as the focal point of the puzzle.
The player can interact with the piano keys, which produce a corresponding note when pressed. The correct sequence of notes is supplied through environmental storytelling, with sheet music locked behind a prior puzzle.

Originally, the sheet music was designed to be part of a larger cryptographic puzzle, but due to time constraints, it was simplified to a direct note sequence.

Prototyped and implemented various puzzles such as:
- Piano puzzle which requires players to find the correct notes in a specific order to unlock a door.
- Fireplace puzzle that physically changes the environment, revealing hidden clues.
- An environmental painting puzzle that requires players to identify the primary colour of a painting to unlock a safe.

I worked alongside three programmers and six artists to create this game over the span of 7 weeks.
