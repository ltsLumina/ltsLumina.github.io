I have experience in broad Game Design, Level Design, and Content Design.
Specifically, I have worked on a variety of projects, including Neon Rivalry, PLORA, and STOKOS.
Responsibilities include designing and implementing core game mechanics, game balance, and level design.
My passion for game design is fueled by the desire to create timeless experiences that people can enjoy for years to come.
