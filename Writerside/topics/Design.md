- Lead designer working on various aspects of the game, including:
  - Game mechanics (puzzles, time travel, and interactions)
  - Level design (house layout, environmental storytelling)
  - UI/UX design (menus, HUD)

Prototyped and implemented various puzzles such as:
- Piano puzzle which requires players to find the correct notes in a specific order to unlock a door.
- Fireplace puzzle that physically changes the environment, revealing hidden clues.
- An environmental painting puzzle that requires players to identify the primary colour of a painting to unlock a safe.

I worked alongside three programmers and six artists to create this game over the span of 7 weeks.
